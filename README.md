PuzzleMe
========

PuzzleMe has a very simple concept, there is a ball and then there is an exit. Simply roll the ball to that exit while avoiding obstacles alongside the way. 
Obstacles can either be procedurally generated or user generated. The main emphasis however is on user generated puzzles, this is to make the entire game play more social.
